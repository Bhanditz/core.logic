From 0.6.5 to 0.6.6

Fixes

* fix lingering reference to old namespace in all macro

From 0.6.4 to 0.6.5
====

Enhancements
---
* Consolidate all the useful name spaces into clojure.core.logic
* We now only overload ==, no more need to exclude reify or inc

You can use core.logic in your own projects with:

```clojure
(ns foo.bar
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [==])
  (:use clojure.core.logic))
```
