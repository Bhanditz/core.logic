core.logic
====

A Logic Programming library for Clojure & ClojureScript. core.logic offers Prolog-like relational programming and constraint logic programming for Clojure. At its heart is an original implementation of miniKanren as described in William Byrd's dissertation [Relational Programming in miniKanren: Techniques, Applications, and Implementations](http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/#abstract?dispub=3380156) as well as the extensions described in [cKanren](http://www.schemeworkshop.org/2011/papers/Alvis2011.pdf)).

If you wish to work through [The Reasoned Schemer](http://mitpress.mit.edu/0262562146) with core.logic make sure to look over [this](http://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/Differences-from-The-Reasoned-Schemer) first.

If you're interested in using core.logic from ClojureScript look [here](http://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/Using-core.logic-with-ClojureScript).
