core.logic projects

* Deeper support for more sophisticated fd equations
** What we currently have are building blocks
** There is no relationship between constratints
** Hunch
*** look for constraints that go together
*** constraints that work together should run even if we don't have singleton domains
*** need to look much closer at exactly how this works in Mozart/Oz
* Sugar for FD equations, (eqfd (= (+ x y z) (+ a b c)))
** TODO Needs eqfd macro sugar
** TODO Needs domain inference
* Search tree tracing
** TODO cKanren-interp branch has a sketch
